This directory contains the source code to

    xmlargs:    Read XML from the standard input or from a file and run an
                external program with text nodes extracted from the XML
		provided as arguments.

    xmlforeach: Read XML from the standard input and run an external program
                on each element found by the given XPath expression.

To compile the project, first create a directory in which to place
the build products.  It is recommended, but not required, that the
build directory be separate from the source directory.  Cd into the
build directory and then from the build directory run the configure
script found at the root of the source tree.  Then run "make".

For example:

    tar xzf xmlargs-X.Y.tar.gz ;#  Unpack the source tree into "sqlite"
    mkdir build                ;#  Build will occur in a sibling directory
    cd build                   ;#  Change to the build directory
    ../xmlargs-X.Y/configure   ;#  Run the configure script
    make                       ;#  Run the makefile.
    make install               ;#  (Optional) Install the build products
